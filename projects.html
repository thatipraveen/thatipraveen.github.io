    <h1>Selected Projects</h1>
    <p>
      These projects represent large-scale, high-impact initiatives
      spanning platform engineering, privacy governance, global commerce,
      and AI-powered productivity. Each reflects how I approach ambiguous
      problems by aligning people, architecture, and execution.

  <!-- PROJECT 1 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>AWS Skill Builder — Enterprise Admin Platform</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        AWS Skill Builder serves millions of learners globally, but
        enterprise customers lacked a unified way to manage training,
        licensing, and learner progress across large organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I led the delivery of a first-party enterprise administration
        platform, designed as a durable foundation rather than a
        one-off feature.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>My role:</strong> Led a <strong>30+ person</strong>
          cross-functional organization spanning engineering, product,
          and program management.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Key decisions:</strong> Treated admin capabilities
          as platform abstractions, separating enterprise concerns
          from learner-facing experiences.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong> Enabled enterprise administration
          for <strong>10M+ learners</strong>, reducing administrative
          friction by ~40%.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- PROJECT 2 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Privacy Governance Platform — 700M+ Devices</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Amazon’s device ecosystem spans hundreds of millions of active
        devices worldwide, subject to evolving privacy regulations
        such as GDPR, CCPA, and COPPA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fragmented privacy controls made it difficult to reason about
        compliance, audit data usage, or enforce consistent policies
        at scale.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>My role:</strong> Led engineering efforts defining
          privacy-first architectural patterns in close partnership
          with Legal, Security, and Compliance teams.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Key decisions:</strong> Centralized policy definition
          while decentralizing enforcement, enabling safe defaults
          without blocking delivery velocity.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong> Enabled privacy governance across
          <strong>700M+ devices</strong> with 100% GDPR/CCPA/COPPA
          compliance and improved audit readiness.
        </p>

  <!-- PROJECT 3 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Global Purchase & Billing Experience</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        AWS Training & Certification purchasing involved complex,
        multi-step checkout flows that created significant user
        friction, especially across international markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge was to simplify the experience while preserving
        security, compliance, and support for global payment methods.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>My role:</strong> Led product-engineering partnership
          across engineering, finance, legal, and security stakeholders.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Key decisions:</strong> Simplified workflows end-to-end,
          reduced duplication, and designed extensible checkout
          abstractions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong> Reduced checkout steps from 18 → 6,
          improved conversion by ~25%, and reduced drop-offs by ~80%
          across <strong>20+ countries</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

  <!-- PROJECT 4 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>AI-Powered Developer Productivity & Automation</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        As platform complexity increased, developers spent significant
        time navigating documentation, codebases, and operational
        knowledge during delivery and incident response.
      </p>
      <p>
        I led initiatives applying AI and automation to improve
        developer efficiency while maintaining strong trust and
        governance guarantees.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>My role:</strong> Defined strategy and led delivery of
          AI-powered knowledge platforms and automation capabilities.

      </div>
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Key decisions:</strong> Focused on augmenting developer
          workflows with guardrails rather than replacing human judgment.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong> Improved developer productivity
          and delivery velocity by ~30% while aligning with responsible
          AI principles.
