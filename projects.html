    <h1>AWS Skill Builder — Enterprise Admin Platform</h1>
    <p>
      A flagship platform enabling enterprises to manage training,
      licensing, and learner progress at global scale.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        AWS Skill Builder serves millions of learners worldwide, but
        enterprise customers lacked a unified way to manage training
        assignments, licenses, and progress across large organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Existing workflows were fragmented, manual, and not designed
        for enterprise scale—creating operational overhead for customers
        and limiting adoption within large accounts.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The platform needed a first-party enterprise administration
        experience that could:
      </p>
      <p>
        • Scale to <strong>millions of learners</strong><br/>
        • Support diverse enterprise workflows and org structures<br/>
        • Integrate cleanly with existing consumer learning systems<br/>
        • Meet strict security, privacy, and compliance requirements<br/>
        • Serve as a foundation for future learning products
      </p>
      <p>
        This was not a feature request—it required rethinking platform
        boundaries, ownership, and long-term extensibility.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- ROLE -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I led the initiative end-to-end, owning organizational design,
        technical direction, roadmap execution, and cross-functional
        alignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        My responsibilities included:
      </p>
      <p>
        • Building and leading a <strong>30+ person</strong> cross-functional org<br/>
        • Partnering with Product to define enterprise requirements and roadmap<br/>
        • Driving architectural decisions for scale and extensibility<br/>
        • Ensuring operational readiness and long-term maintainability
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- CHALLENGES -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Enterprise complexity:</strong> Customers had diverse
          organizational models, approval workflows, and licensing needs
          that could not be solved with one-size-fits-all designs.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Platform boundaries:</strong> The solution needed to
          coexist with existing consumer learning systems without
          creating tight coupling or duplicated logic.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card list-card">
        <p>
          <strong>Scale & reliability:</strong> Admin workflows had to
          operate reliably at global scale with strong consistency
          guarantees and auditability.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- DECISIONS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Key Decisions</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        We deliberately designed the admin experience as a
        <strong>platform capability</strong>, not a standalone UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key decisions included:
      </p>
      <p>
        • Creating extensible abstractions for assignments, licensing,
          and org management<br/>
        • Separating admin concerns from learner-facing experiences<br/>
        • Designing APIs and data models to support future products<br/>
        • Prioritizing operability, auditability, and observability
      </p>
      <p>
        These choices reduced short-term velocity but enabled long-term
        scalability and reuse.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- TAKEAWAY -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>What This Demonstrates</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This project reflects my approach to leadership:
        solving ambiguous problems by aligning people, architecture,
        and execution around long-term business outcomes—not just
        shipping features.
